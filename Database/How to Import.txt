Hi, 

Thanks for downloading this project, a lot of people import this SQL file the wrong way.
That's why i created this file to guide you somehow!

I assume you use phpMyAdmin for your local databases.

Step 1: Craete a new database and name it "foodiedb" -  Should be the exact name i named it.
Step 2: Select it and click "Import" - Make sure the title reads <Importing into dataabase "foodiedb">
Step 3: Choose the file from C:\xampp\htdocs\foodie\Database
Step 4: Scroll down the page and check if Format id SQL.

Step 5: Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Import"

You are good to go!

You might still find some challenges for some reasons, please contact me i wil help you!
Thank You!
